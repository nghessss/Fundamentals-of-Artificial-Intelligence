\section{Program Execution Guide}

\qquad In the source code, we used Python version 3 to build this program without using any external libraries. We solely relied on the built-in Python functions, so users do not need to install anything to run it.

\qquad Below, we will provide comprehensive instructions on running Python program in version 3 on different operating systems, aimed at readers who may not have prior experience.

\subsection{Window}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3pt, parsep=2pt, topsep=2pt, leftmargin=1.5cm]
    \item Open the command prompt.
    \item Navigate to the directory where the program is located using the `cd' command.
    \item To run the program, type the following command and replace [filename] with the actual name of your Python file:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=terminal]
  python [filename].py
\end{lstlisting}
    \item Alternatively, you can also run it like this:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=terminal]
  python3 [filename].py
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Unix Based Operating Systems}

\begin{enumerate}[itemsep=3pt, parsep=2pt, topsep=2pt, leftmargin=1.5cm]
    \item Open the terminal.
    \item Navigate to the directory where the program is located using the `cd' command.
    \item To run the program, type the following command and replace [filename] with the actual name of your Python file:
\begin{lstlisting}[style=terminal]
  python3 [filename].py
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
